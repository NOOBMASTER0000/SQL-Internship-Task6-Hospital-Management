# HospitalDB Task 6

This repository contains SQL scripts for **Task 6** of the HospitalDB project.  
It demonstrates the use of **subqueries and nested queries** to perform advanced data retrieval operations.

## Features
- Scalar subqueries in `SELECT` clause.
- Correlated subqueries for conditional filtering.
- Use of `IN`, `EXISTS`, and derived tables (`FROM` subqueries).
- Nested subqueries with multiple levels of logic.
- Demonstrates real-world query structuring in SQL.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `task6.sql` script in your SQL environment (MySQL/SQLite).
3. Review query outputs for subquery and nested query examples.

## Objective
Enhance understanding of how **subqueries** work inside different SQL clauses  
and how they can simplify complex data relationships.
